1. **Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability**
   - **Description**: The script uses the `include` function with a parameter (`stylepath`) directly taken from the GET request without any sanitization or validation. This can allow an attacker to include files from the server that are not intended to be exposed, or even execute arbitrary code if the server is configured to allow it.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 10: `<?php include($_GET['stylepath']); ?>`

2. **HTML Form Input Redundancy**
   - **Description**: The form element `<input type="hidden" name="style" name="stylepath">` incorrectly declares the `name` attribute twice. This is likely a mistake and could lead to unexpected behavior as the second declaration (`name="stylepath"`) will override the first (`name="style"`).
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 6: `<input type="hidden" name="style" name="stylepath">`

To address these issues:
- For the LFI vulnerability, ensure that any file inclusion is validated against a list of allowed files or directories, or better yet, avoid directly including files based on user input.
- Correct the HTML input element to have a single, correctly named `name` attribute.
