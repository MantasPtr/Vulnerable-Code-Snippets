1. **Security Issue: Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level:** High
   - **Line Number and Content:**
     - Line 11: `$file = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['file']);`
     - Line 13: `include("pages/$file");`
   - **Description:** The code attempts to mitigate directory traversal by removing occurrences of '../' from the `file` parameter. However, this is insufficient as it only removes the exact string '../' and does not account for other forms of directory traversal such as encoded variations (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f`). An attacker could potentially include arbitrary files from the server, leading to information disclosure or execution of server-side scripts.

2. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent Indentation and Spacing**
   - **Severity Level:** Low
   - **Line Number and Content:**
     - Line 1: `<?php     include("../common/header.php");   ?>`
     - Line 5: `<form action="/LFI-5/index.php" method="GET">`
   - **Description:** The PHP opening tag and the `include` statement have inconsistent spacing. Proper formatting and consistent indentation improve code readability and maintainability.

3. **Logic Issue: Check for `isset` on the wrong variable**
   - **Severity Level:** Medium
   - **Line Number and Content:**
     - Line 12: `if(isset($file))`
   - **Description:** The `isset` function is used to check if a variable is set and is not null. However, since `$file` is always set (either to a modified `$_GET['file']` or an empty string if `$_GET['file']` is not set), this check is not meaningful. The intention might be to check if `$_GET['file']` is set before processing it. This could lead to unexpected behavior when `$_GET['file']` is not provided, as `include("pages/$file");` will attempt to include a directory named "pages/" without a specific file, potentially leading to errors or unintended behavior.

To address these issues:
- For issue 1, consider using a whitelist of allowed files or a more robust method to sanitize the input to prevent directory traversal.
- For issue 2, clean up the formatting for better readability.
- For issue 3, adjust the `isset` check to verify `$_GET['file']` directly before assigning and using `$file`.
