1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Description**: The code constructs SQL queries by directly appending user input (`username`) into the SQL string. This practice can lead to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the query to access unauthorized data or perform malicious actions on the database.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     - Line 3: `String query = "SELECT secret FROM Users WHERE (username = '" + username + "' AND NOT role = 'admin')";`
     - Line 6: `String query2 = String.format("SELECT secret FROM Users WHERE (username = '%s' AND NOT role = 'admin')", username);`

2. **Use of Statement instead of PreparedStatement**
   - **Description**: The code uses `Statement` for executing SQL queries. For better security and performance, especially when including user inputs in the query, it is recommended to use `PreparedStatement`. This not only helps in preventing SQL injection but also improves performance by pre-compiling the SQL statement.
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     - Line 2: `Statement statement = connection.createStatement();`

To resolve these issues, you should use `PreparedStatement` and parameterize the SQL query to safely include user inputs. Here is an example of how you can modify the code:

```java
String username = request.getParameter("username");
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT secret FROM Users WHERE username = ? AND NOT role = 'admin'");
preparedStatement.setString(1, username);
ResultSet result = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```
