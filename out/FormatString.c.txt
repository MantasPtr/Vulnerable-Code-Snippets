1. **Description of the issue**: The code uses `printf` in an unsafe manner by directly passing `argv[1]` as the format string. This can lead to format string vulnerabilities if the input is not controlled, allowing an attacker to read or write memory, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or crashing the program.

2. **Severity level**: High

3. **Line number and the content of the problematic line**:
   - Line 6: `printf external link(argv[1]);`

Additionally, there is a syntax error in the code:

1. **Description of the issue**: The syntax used for calling `printf` is incorrect. It seems like a typo or a misunderstanding of how to use `printf`. The correct usage should be `printf("%s", argv[1]);` if the intention is to print the string passed as an argument.

2. **Severity level**: High (as it will prevent the program from compiling)

3. **Line number and the content of the problematic line**:
   - Line 6: `printf external link(argv[1]);`
