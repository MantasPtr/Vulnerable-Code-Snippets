1. **Security Issue: Local File Inclusion (LFI)**
   - **Severity Level**: Critical
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     include($_GET["page"]);
     ```
   - **Description**: The script uses the `include` function with a parameter directly taken from user input (`$_GET["page"]`). This is highly insecure as it allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other security impacts. This type of vulnerability is known as Local File Inclusion (LFI).

2. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent Indentation and Spacing**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     <?php     include("../common/header.php");   ?>
     ```
   - **Description**: The PHP opening tag and the `include` statement have inconsistent spacing. Proper and consistent indentation and spacing improve code readability and maintainability.

3. **Security Issue: Missing Input Validation**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     <input type="text" name="page">
     ```
   - **Description**: The form input for "page" lacks any validation or sanitization, both on the client-side and server-side. This contributes to the LFI vulnerability by allowing any input to be submitted and processed.

To mitigate these issues, especially the critical LFI vulnerability, it is recommended to validate and sanitize all user inputs. For the file inclusion, use a whitelist of allowed files or change the logic to avoid directly including files based on user input.
