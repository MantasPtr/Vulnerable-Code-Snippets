1. **Security Issue: Template Injection**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 10: `renderer = Template('Hello, ' + request.args['name'])`
   - **Description**: The code directly incorporates user input (`request.args['name']`) into a Jinja2 template. This can lead to a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) if the user input is malicious. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting this vulnerability.

2. **Security/Configuration Issue: Debug Mode Enabled in Production**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 6: `app.config['DEBUG'] = True`
   - **Description**: The application is configured to run with debug mode enabled (`DEBUG = True`). While this is useful during development for providing detailed error messages and interactive debugging, it should not be enabled in a production environment as it can leak sensitive information about the application, its environment, and its data.

3. **Code Style Issue: Import Redundancy**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 3: `import flask`
   - **Description**: The module `flask` is imported but then not used directly, as `Flask` is imported specifically from `flask`. This redundant import could be removed to clean up the code.

To address these issues:
- For issue 1, avoid directly embedding user input into templates. Use context variables or proper sanitization methods.
- For issue 2, ensure that the debug mode is disabled in production environments.
- For issue 3, remove the redundant import of the entire `flask` module if it's not used elsewhere in the code.
