1. **Description of the issue**: Hardcoding sensitive information such as `secret_key_base` in the source code is a security risk. This key should be kept secret and not exposed in the codebase, as it can be used to sign and decrypt cookies in a Rails application. If exposed, it could allow attackers to tamper with session data.
   
2. **Severity level**: High

3. **Line number and content**:
   - Line 4: `Railsgoat::Application.config.secret_key_base = "2f1d90a26236c3245d96f5606c201a780dc9ca687e5ed82b45e211bb5dc84c1870f61ca9e002dad5dd8a149c9792d8f07f31a9575065cca064bd6af44f8750e4"`
