1. **Issue Description**: The code directly assigns `event.data` to the innerHTML of an element. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the data from `event` is not properly sanitized and contains malicious scripts.

2. **Severity Level**: High

3. **Line Number and Content**:
   - Line 5: `document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;`

To mitigate this issue, consider sanitizing the data or using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` if the intention is to display text. This prevents the execution of any embedded HTML or JavaScript.
