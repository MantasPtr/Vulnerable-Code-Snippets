1. **Issue: Use of Unsafe Function `scanf`**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```c
     scanf("%s", name);
     ```
   - **Description**: The use of `scanf` with `%s` to read a string is unsafe because it does not check the length of the input, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input exceeds the buffer size (64 bytes in this case). This can potentially allow arbitrary code execution or cause the program to crash.

2. **Issue: Undefined Function `Sanitize`**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```c
     Sanitize(name);
     ```
   - **Description**: The function `Sanitize` is called but not defined anywhere in the provided code snippet. This will lead to a linker error unless the function is defined elsewhere. If the function is intended to sanitize the input for potentially dangerous characters, its absence could lead to security risks, especially when dealing with outputs like in `printf`.

3. **Issue: Potential Format String Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```c
     printf("Welcome, %s!", name);
     ```
   - **Description**: Using `printf` with a variable (`name`) directly in the format string can lead to format string vulnerabilities if the input (`name`) contains format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`). This can be exploited to cause crashes, read out of bounds memory, or execute arbitrary code.

**Recommendations**:
- Replace `scanf("%s", name)` with `fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin)` to safely read the input with a limit.
- Ensure `Sanitize` function is properly defined and implemented, or remove the call if unnecessary.
- Use `printf("Welcome, %s!", name)` safely by ensuring that `name` does not contain format specifiers or by using `printf("Welcome, "); printf("%s!", name);` to avoid format string issues.
