1. **Issue: Lack of Input Sanitization and Output Escaping**
   - **Description**: The `name` variable retrieved from the `$_GET` superglobal is directly used in the output without any sanitization or escaping. This can lead to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability where malicious scripts can be executed in the browser of anyone who clicks a link containing harmful input.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     echo 'Hello, ' . $_GET['name']
     ```

2. **Issue: Missing Semicolon**
   - **Description**: The line where the `echo` statement is used is missing a semicolon at the end. This is a syntax error and will cause the script to fail.
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```php
     echo 'Hello, ' . $_GET['name']
     ```
