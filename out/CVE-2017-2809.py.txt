1. **Issue: Insecure YAML Loading**
   - **Description**: The method `yaml.load()` is used without specifying a Loader. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is from an untrusted source.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 13: `return yaml.load(self.vault.decrypt(stream)) [0]`

2. **Issue: Insecure Storage of Password**
   - **Description**: The password is stored in plain text within the instance of the class. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if the instance is exposed or if the memory is dumped.
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 7: `self.password = password`

3. **Issue: Typo in Comment**
   - **Description**: The comment says "read vault steam" instead of "read vault stream".
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: Line 10: `'''read vault steam and return python object'''`

To address these issues:
- For issue 1, use `yaml.safe_load()` instead of `yaml.load()` to avoid potential security risks.
- For issue 2, consider encrypting the password within the class or using more secure methods to handle sensitive data.
- For issue 3, correct the typo in the comment for better readability and accuracy.
