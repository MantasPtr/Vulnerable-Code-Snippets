1. **Security Issue: Insecure Deserialization**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     var obj = serialize.unserialize(str);
     ```
   - **Description**: The use of `serialize.unserialize` without proper validation or sanitization of the input can lead to security vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution (RCE). Deserializing user-controlled input can be dangerous if the input is not strictly controlled and validated.

2. **Security Issue: Use of Deprecated Buffer Constructor**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```javascript
     var str = new Buffer(req.cookies.profile, 'base64').toString();
     ```
   - **Description**: The use of `new Buffer()` is deprecated due to security and reliability issues. It's recommended to use `Buffer.from()` instead to handle Buffer creation as it's safer and more reliable.

3. **Logic Issue: Response Handling**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```javascript
     res.send("Hello World");
     ```
   - **Description**: The `res.send("Hello World")` is called unconditionally at the end of the route handler, which means it will execute regardless of whether the condition `if (req.cookies.profile)` is true or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior where the server sends two responses to the same request if the cookie is set, which will cause an error.

4. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent Use of Semicolons**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```javascript
     app.use(cookieParser())
     ```
   - **Description**: The project inconsistently uses semicolons. Some lines end with semicolons while others do not. It's a good practice to maintain consistency in coding style for better readability and to avoid potential pitfalls in JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion.

5. **Performance Issue: Redundant Serialization**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```javascript
     res.cookie('profile', "eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFqaW4iLCJjb3VudHJ5IjoiaW5kaWEiLCJjaXR5IjoiYmFuZ2Fsb3JlIn0=", {
       maxAge: 900000,
       httpOnly: true
     });
     ```
   - **Description**: The hardcoded base64 string for the cookie 'profile' is inefficient and not flexible. It would be better to serialize an object dynamically based on actual user data. This would improve maintainability and flexibility of the code.

Recommendations:
- Replace `new Buffer()` with `Buffer.from()`.
- Ensure proper validation and sanitization when deserializing data.
- Fix the logic to prevent sending multiple responses in a single request handler.
- Standardize the use of semicolons throughout the code.
- Consider dynamically generating the serialized data for cookies based on actual user data.
