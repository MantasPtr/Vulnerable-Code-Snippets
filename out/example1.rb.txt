1. **Issue: Use of `eval` Function**
   - **Description**: The use of `eval` for evaluating expressions directly from user input can lead to security vulnerabilities such as code injection. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by providing malicious input.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```ruby
     print eval(first_number+"+"+second_number)
     ```

2. **Issue: Commented Conversion to Integer**
   - **Description**: The conversion of input arguments to integers is commented out. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when performing arithmetic operations, as the inputs are treated as strings.
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```ruby
     first_number  = ARGV[0]#.to_i
     second_number = ARGV[1]#.to_i
     ```

3. **Issue: Output Formatting**
   - **Description**: The use of `print` with multiple arguments and a newline character is unconventional and can lead to confusing output formatting. It's better to use string interpolation or formatting for clearer and more maintainable code.
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```ruby
     print "Args:",first_number,second_number,"
     "
     ```

To address these issues:
- Replace `eval` with a safer alternative for arithmetic operations.
- Uncomment the `.to_i` to ensure the inputs are treated as integers.
- Improve the output formatting for better readability and maintainability.
