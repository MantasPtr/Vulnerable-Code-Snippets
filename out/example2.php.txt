This PHP script has a critical security issue:

1. **Description of the issue**: The script is vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack. It directly uses user input from `$_GET['file']` to specify a file path where data is written. This can be exploited by an attacker to write arbitrary data to any file on the server, which could include PHP files, thereby allowing arbitrary code execution.
   
2. **Severity level**: Critical

3. **Line number and content**:
   - Line 3: `$file = $_GET['file'];`
   - Line 4: `file_put_contents("/some/path/$file",$content);`

Additionally, there is a minor issue related to the use of an undefined variable:

1. **Description of the issue**: The script attempts to close a file handle `$fh` that is never opened or defined anywhere in the script. This will generate a PHP notice (undefined variable) and attempt to close a non-existent resource.

2. **Severity level**: Low

3. **Line number and content**:
   - Line 5: `fclose($fh);`

Recommendations:
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially when they are used in file operations.
- Consider using a whitelist of allowed filenames or patterns.
- Remove or correct the unnecessary `fclose($fh);` line, as it serves no purpose in the current context.
