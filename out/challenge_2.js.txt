1. **Issue: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     tokenSpan.innerText = message.data;
     ```
   - **Description**: The code directly assigns `message.data` to `innerText` of an HTML element. If `message.data` contains any HTML or JavaScript code, it will not be executed because `innerText` is used, which treats the input as plain text. However, the practice of directly assigning data from an untrusted source (like a message event) to the DOM can lead to security risks if the code is modified to use `innerHTML` or similar properties that do interpret HTML/JS. It's a good practice to validate or sanitize the input even when using `innerText`.

2. **Issue: Lack of Validation for Message Origin**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);
     ```
   - **Description**: The `receiveMessage` function does not check the origin of the message. This can lead to security vulnerabilities where the page might process messages from any source, including malicious ones. It's important to verify the origin of the message to ensure it's from a trusted source.

3. **Issue: Ambiguous Placeholder Text**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     tokenSpan.innerText = "<Unset>";
     ```
   - **Description**: The placeholder text `<Unset>` might be confusing as it looks like an HTML tag. It would be clearer to use a plain text string like "Unset" or "Not provided" to avoid any confusion.

To address these issues:
- For issue 1, continue using `innerText` but consider adding input validation or sanitization as a precaution.
- For issue 2, add a check to verify the origin of the message before processing it.
- For issue 3, change the placeholder text to a more straightforward string.
