1. **Security Issue: Insecure File Upload Handling**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     if (in_array($this->file['name'], $this->whitelist)) {
         move_uploaded_file(
             $this->file['tmp_name'],
             self::UPLOAD_DIRECTORY . $this->file['name']
         );
     }
     ```
   - **Description**: The code checks if the file name is in a whitelist before moving it to a directory. However, this check is insufficient for security because it only validates the file name, not its content or type. This can lead to arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities where an attacker could upload a malicious script disguised with a valid name. Additionally, there's no check to prevent overwriting existing files, which could lead to unintended data loss or other security implications.

2. **Logic Issue: Whitelist Check Misuse**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     $this->whitelist = range(1, 24);
     ```
   - **Description**: The whitelist is initialized with a range of numbers from 1 to 24, which seems to be intended for some form of ID or numeric check. However, it is used to check against the file name in the destruct method. This is likely a logic error as file names are typically strings, not just numeric values. This could lead to all file uploads being rejected if the names do not strictly match the numeric values in the whitelist.

3. **Code Style Issue: Magic Numbers**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     $this->whitelist = range(1, 24);
     ```
   - **Description**: The use of magic numbers (1, 24) directly in the code without explanation or being defined as constants reduces code readability and maintainability. It's unclear why the numbers 1 through 24 are used, making the code less intuitive and harder to modify or debug.

4. **Performance Issue: Destructor Usage for Business Logic**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```php
     public function __destruct() {
         if (in_array($this->file['name'], $this->whitelist)) {
             move_uploaded_file(
                 $this->file['tmp_name'],
                 self::UPLOAD_DIRECTORY . $this->file['name']
             );
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Description**: Using the destructor method to handle file uploads is unconventional and can lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior, especially if exceptions occur or if multiple instances of the class are created and destroyed. It's generally better to handle such operations explicitly in a dedicated method where errors can be handled more gracefully and the operation's success can be verified.

Recommendations:
- Implement thorough validation checks on the file type, size, and content before moving it to a secure location.
- Avoid using destructors for critical operations like file uploads.
- Replace magic numbers with well-named constants to improve code clarity.
- Ensure file names are sanitized to prevent overwriting and other file-related vulnerabilities.
