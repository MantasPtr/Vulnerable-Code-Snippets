The provided code snippet has several issues related to security, code style, and potential logic errors:

1. **Security Issue: Arbitrary File Inclusion**
   - **Description**: The `__toString()` method in the `ViewFile` class includes a file based on the `$filename` property. This can lead to arbitrary file inclusion vulnerabilities if the `$filename` can be controlled by an attacker.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: `public function __toString() { include $this->filename; return ""; }`

2. **Security Issue: Object Injection**
   - **Description**: The code uses `unserialize()` on user-supplied input without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to object injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker could instantiate arbitrary PHP objects and potentially trigger malicious actions.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: `$pdfobject = unserialize(base64_decode($_GET['page']));`

3. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent Bracing Style**
   - **Description**: The code uses different bracing styles (K&R and Allman). Consistency in coding style is important for readability and maintainability.
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: Multiple lines, including `public function __toString() { include $this->filename; return ""; }` and the if-else structure.

4. **Logic Error: Incorrect Class Instantiation**
   - **Description**: The code attempts to instantiate a class named `File` if the 'page' parameter is not set in the GET request. However, the class `File` is not defined anywhere in the provided snippet. This will lead to a fatal error if the else branch is executed.
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: `else { $pdfobject = new File(); }`

5. **Security Issue: Lack of Input Validation**
   - **Description**: There is no validation on the content of `$_GET['page']` before it is decoded and unserialized. This poses a risk of malformed or malicious data being processed.
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: `$pdfobject = unserialize(base64_decode($_GET['page']));`

To address these issues:
- Implement strict validation and sanitization on user inputs.
- Avoid using `unserialize()` on user-supplied data or use a safer serialization method like JSON.
- Ensure consistent coding style.
- Define the `File` class or handle the case where it might not exist.
- Use a secure method for file inclusion that does not allow arbitrary file paths.
