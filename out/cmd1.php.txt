1. **Security Issue: Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
   - **Severity Level**: Critical
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 8: `system($_GET["cmd"]);`
   - **Description**: The use of `system()` with user-supplied input (`$_GET["cmd"]`) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, and potentially taking control of the server.

2. **Security Issue: Lack of Input Validation**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 8: `system($_GET["cmd"]);`
   - **Description**: There is no validation or sanitization on the input received from the user. This exacerbates the risk of malicious input leading to severe security vulnerabilities such as the aforementioned RCE.

3. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent Indentation**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 1: `<?php     include("../common/header.php");   ?>`
     - Line 8: `system($_GET["cmd"]);`
   - **Description**: The code uses inconsistent spacing and indentation, which can make the code less readable and maintainable.

4. **Security Issue: Use of Relative Path**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 1: `include("../common/header.php");`
   - **Description**: Using relative paths in `include()` can lead to potential security risks if the directory structure is exposed or manipulated. It's safer to use absolute paths or to validate the path.

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately remove or properly secure the use of `system()` with user inputs.
- Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization.
- Standardize code formatting for better readability and maintenance.
- Consider using absolute paths for file inclusions and validate paths to mitigate directory traversal attacks.
