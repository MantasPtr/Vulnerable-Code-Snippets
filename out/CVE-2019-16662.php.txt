1. **Security Issue: Unsanitized Input Used in Command**
   - **Severity Level:** Critical
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 10: `$rootTestCmd1 = 'sudo -S -u ' . $rootUname . ' chmod 0777 /home 2>&1';`
     - Line 18: `$rootTestCmd2 = 'sudo -S -u ' . $rootUname . ' chmod 0755 /home 2>&1';`
   - **Description:** The variable `$rootUname` is directly taken from user input (`$_GET['rootUname']`) and used in constructing a shell command. This can lead to command injection if the user input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially manipulate the command to execute arbitrary code.

2. **Security Issue: Directly Modifying File Permissions**
   - **Severity Level:** High
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 10: `$rootTestCmd1 = 'sudo -S -u ' . $rootUname . ' chmod 0777 /home 2>&1';`
     - Line 18: `$rootTestCmd2 = 'sudo -S -u ' . $rootUname . ' chmod 0755 /home 2>&1';`
   - **Description:** The script changes the permissions of the `/home` directory to `0777` (world-writable) which is highly insecure, even if it is intended to be temporary. This could expose the server to unauthorized access and modification.

3. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent HTML Tag Closure**
   - **Severity Level:** Low
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 5: `$array['phpSafeMode'] = '<strong><font class="bad">Fail - php safe mode is on - turn it off before you proceed with the installation</strong></font>br/>';`
   - **Description:** The HTML `<br/>` tag is incorrectly appended as `br/` outside the closing `</font>` tag. This is a typo and should be corrected to maintain proper HTML structure.

4. **Security Issue: Information Disclosure**
   - **Severity Level:** Medium
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 15: `$array['rootDetails'] = '<strong><font class="bad">The root details provided have not passed: ' . $cmdOutput[0] . '</strong></font><br/>';`
   - **Description:** The script outputs the result of the command execution (`$cmdOutput[0]`) directly in the response. This could potentially expose sensitive server information or error details to the user, which might be used for further attacks.

5. **Security Issue: PHP Safe Mode Check**
   - **Severity Level:** Medium
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 4: `if (ini_get('safe_mode')) {`
   - **Description:** The script checks for PHP's `safe_mode`, which is deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0 and removed in PHP 5.4.0. Relying on this feature for security checks is outdated and might not provide the intended protections in newer PHP environments.

Recommendations:
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs, especially when used in system commands.
- Avoid changing permissions of critical system directories to insecure settings.
- Correct HTML syntax errors.
- Avoid disclosing potentially sensitive information in error messages or command outputs.
- Update the security checks to align with current PHP configurations and best practices.
