1. **Issue: SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```java
     String url = "jdbc:mysql://10.12.1.34/" + request.getParameter("selectedDB");
     ```
   - **Description**: The code directly concatenates user input (`request.getParameter("selectedDB")`) into the database connection URL without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection attacks where an attacker could manipulate the URL to access unauthorized data or perform malicious actions.

2. **Issue: Use of Deprecated or Outdated Class**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```java
     Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();
     ```
   - **Description**: The class `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` is deprecated and has been replaced by `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`. Additionally, calling `newInstance()` is not necessary for loading the driver since JDBC 4.0 automatically loads the driver.

3. **Issue: Exception Handling**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```java
     catch(ClassNotFoundException cnfe)
     {
     // TODO: manage exception
     }
     catch(SQLException se)
     {
     // TODO: manage exception
     }
     catch(InstantiationException ie)
     {
     // TODO: manage exception
     }
     finally
     {
     // TODO: manage conn
     }
     ```
   - **Description**: The exception blocks only contain comments to manage exceptions but do not implement any actual handling logic. This can lead to unmanaged errors and poor debugging or user experience. Proper logging, user notification, or error recovery mechanisms should be implemented.

4. **Issue: Resource Management**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```java
     finally
     {
     // TODO: manage conn
     }
     ```
   - **Description**: The `finally` block suggests managing the database connection but does not implement closing of the connection. This can lead to resource leaks, where database connections remain open longer than necessary, potentially exhausting database resources.

5. **Issue: Hardcoded Database IP**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**:
     ```java
     String url = "jdbc:mysql://10.12.1.34/" + request.getParameter("selectedDB");
     ```
   - **Description**: The database IP address is hardcoded, which reduces flexibility and increases maintenance effort if the database location changes. It is better to externalize such configurations to configuration files or environment variables.

Each of these issues should be addressed to improve the security, maintainability, and performance of the code.
