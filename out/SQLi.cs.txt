1. **Issue: SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 20: `using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM users WHERE userId = '" + id + "'"))`
   - **Description**: The method `DoSqli` constructs an SQL query by directly concatenating the input `id` with the query string. This practice is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the `id` parameter to execute arbitrary SQL code.

2. **Issue: Inefficient String Concatenation in a Loop**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 28: `res += reader["userName"];`
   - **Description**: The use of `+=` for string concatenation inside a loop can lead to performance issues, especially with a large number of iterations. Each concatenation creates a new string object, which can be inefficient in terms of memory and processing time. It's better to use `StringBuilder` for such scenarios.

3. **Issue: Potential Resource Leak**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 24: `SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();`
   - **Description**: The `SqlDataReader` object `reader` is not enclosed in a `using` statement, which means it is not guaranteed to be properly disposed of if an exception occurs before the method returns. This can lead to unmanaged resources not being released properly.

4. **Issue: Hardcoded Connection String**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 19: `string conString = "I AM a connection String";`
   - **Description**: The connection string is hardcoded within the method, which is not a good practice. It should ideally be retrieved from a configuration file or environment variable to enhance security and flexibility, allowing changes without needing to recompile the code.

5. **Issue: Method Returns Sensitive Data**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 20-33: Entire `DoSqli` method
   - **Description**: The method returns user names directly, which might include sensitive information. Depending on the context, exposing such information could be a privacy concern. Consider if this exposure is necessary or if additional measures (like authorization) are needed.

6. **Issue: Lack of Input Validation**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 20: `using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM users WHERE userId = '" + id + "'"))`
   - **Description**: There is no validation on the `id` parameter. Malformed or unexpected input could lead to errors or security vulnerabilities (such as the SQL injection mentioned above). Input should be validated or sanitized before use.

These issues should be addressed to ensure the security and efficiency of the code.
