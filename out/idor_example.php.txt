1. **Security Issue: SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level:** High
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 9: `$id = $_GET['id'];`
     - Line 11: `$query = $db->query('select * from secrets where id = ' . (int)$id);`
   - **Description:** Although the code attempts to cast the `id` parameter to an integer, which is a good practice to prevent SQL injection, the approach is not foolproof. A safer approach would be to use prepared statements with bound parameters. This ensures that the input is treated strictly as data and not executable code, preventing SQL injection attacks.

2. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent Commenting**
   - **Severity Level:** Low
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 3: `// this database contains a table with 2 rows`
     - Line 17: `// view all the user's secrets (WHERE user_id = 1)`
   - **Description:** The comments in the code are not very informative and are inconsistent. Comments should be used to explain "why" something is done, not "what" is done, unless the operation is complex. Additionally, the comment style and detail level should be consistent throughout the codebase.

3. **Performance Issue: Potential Large Data Retrieval**
   - **Severity Level:** Medium
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 17: `$query = $db->query('select * from secrets where user_id = 1');`
   - **Description:** The query retrieves all secrets for a user without any form of pagination or limitation. This could potentially lead to performance issues if the number of secrets is large. Implementing pagination or limiting the number of results returned at one time can help mitigate this issue.

4. **Security Issue: Direct Path Disclosure**
   - **Severity Level:** Medium
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Line 3: `require_once('../_helpers/strip.php');`
   - **Description:** Using relative paths in `require_once` can potentially expose the server to directory traversal attacks if not properly handled. It's safer to use absolute paths derived from a server-controlled variable (like `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`).

5. **Code Style Issue: HTML mixed with PHP**
   - **Severity Level:** Low
   - **Line Number and Content:** 
     - Multiple lines, e.g., Line 14: `echo '<br /><br /><a href="/">Go back</a>';`
   - **Description:** Mixing HTML directly in PHP script makes the code harder to maintain and read. It's generally a better practice to separate HTML from PHP logic by templating or at least structuring the output more cleanly.

Recommendations for improvements include using prepared statements for database queries, implementing pagination for data retrieval, using absolute paths for file inclusions, and separating HTML from PHP logic for better maintainability and readability.
