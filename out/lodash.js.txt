1. **Security Issue: Potential Prototype Pollution**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     lodash.defaultsDeep(config, JSON.parse(req.body.config));
     ```
   - **Description**: The use of `lodash.defaultsDeep` with user-supplied input (`req.body.config`) can lead to prototype pollution if not properly sanitized. Prototype pollution can allow an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, leading to potential code execution and application vulnerabilities.

2. **Security Issue: Incomplete User Authentication**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     function getCurrentUser(){
       // TODO: implement this function
       return false;
     }
     ```
   - **Description**: The `getCurrentUser` function is not implemented and always returns `false`. This means the application cannot differentiate between authenticated and unauthenticated users, which is a critical flaw in any authentication logic.

3. **Code Style Issue: Inconsistent Use of Semicolons**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     const router = express.Router()
     ```
   - **Description**: The code inconsistently uses semicolons. Some lines end with semicolons while others do not. It is a good practice to maintain consistency in code styling to improve readability and maintainability.

4. **Logic Issue: User Object Handling**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     if(!user){
       user = {};
     }
     ```
   - **Description**: The check for `user` being falsy and then setting it to an empty object `{}` is potentially problematic. If `getCurrentUser` is supposed to return `false` or `null` when no user is authenticated, the subsequent check `user.isAdmin` will fail because `isAdmin` will be `undefined` on an empty object. This could lead to incorrect application behavior where no clear distinction is made between different types of users or unauthenticated requests.

5. **Performance Issue: Redundant Library Load**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```javascript
     const lodash = require('lodash');
     ```
   - **Description**: The entire `lodash` library is loaded just to use `defaultsDeep`. This can be optimized by requiring only the necessary function from lodash, which can reduce the overall load time and resource consumption.

Recommendations:
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs, especially when using functions like `lodash.defaultsDeep` that can modify object properties deeply.
- Implement the `getCurrentUser` function to properly handle user authentication and session management.
- Maintain consistent coding style, particularly with the use of semicolons.
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms are in place, especially in authentication and authorization processes.
- Optimize library imports to load only necessary modules or functions.
